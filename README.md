## This Repo
* This repo is for storing AOC2025 code for my friends and family!

## Goals for AOC2025
* I hope to full start AOC2025, after a lackluster finishing rate in AOC2023. I make no guarantee that i will finish by the 12th, but i will aim to complete all of the challenges before or during january 2026!

***Good Coding!***
